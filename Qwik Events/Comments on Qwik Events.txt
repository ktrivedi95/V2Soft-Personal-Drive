Receieve a notification (either on the phone screen or in the App itself) when an event invitation is received
	Maybe a simple bubble over the 'Invited Events' Button with the number of invitations that are still pending

Display in Invitation (checkbox for phone) does not check for a valid phone number or any phone number
	As of now, I can click on the checkbox and proceed to next step without entering a phone number

Deleting Guests from the Add Invitees page and then clicking Home does not persist the changes
	The guests are back on the list

Choosing from a list, it doesn't close the list even after clicking on the choice

Can an event be more than one day long?
	On the phone, the event says it has to end on the same day that it is held
